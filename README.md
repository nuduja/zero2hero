#### Why React?

Now, the main question arises in front of us is why one should use React. There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier. Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React over other competitive technologies or frameworks.

**1. Simplicity**
 
The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it.
 
**2. Easy to learn**
 
Anyone with a basic knowledge of CSS and HTML can easily understand React. 

**3. Native Approach**
 
React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time, we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.
 
**4. Data Binding**
 
React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point â€“ the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.
 
**5. Performance** 
 
React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.
 
**6. Testability**
 
One of the things that make React so great is how convenient it is to test React-based apps. React views can be treated as functions of the state. As a result, React developers can work closely with testing engineers to manipulate any states moved across React View
